In their study, Topalli and Cagiltay examined the question how implementing Scratch, a graphical programming language, can improve the process of learning programming in higher education (2018). Scratch is a graphical programming language, created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to enable non-programmers to encounter the digital world. Millions of users, including children, share their projects online.

### Overview

>[!Example] Topalli & Cagiltay (2018)
> ##### Goal of the Study
> Examine, how implementing Scratch in programming education can impact students' programming abilities.
> ##### Main Findings
> Enriching an introductory programming course with Scratch improves students' programming abilities. This improvement showed in the students' senior project years later.
> - [[Effect sizes#Higher Academic Achievement in Introduction to Programming Course for Students with Scratch|Higher course grades]] of students in  Scratch-enriched course in comparison to students in regular course
> - [[Effect sizes#Higher Performance in Graduation Projects for Students with Scratch|Higher grades]] in graduation project by students in Scratch-enriched course
> - [[Effect sizes#No Difference in Overall Grades for Students with Scratch and Students with Traditional Course|No difference]] in overall grades between students in Scratch-enriched course and students in traditional course


For one semester, an "Introduction to Programming"-course was supplemented with Scratch. As in previous semesters, students learned theoretical programming concepts and the programming language C. In this semester, students additionaly received an introduction to Scratch and created their own projects in Scratch. These students performed better in the course in comparison to other years. Even years later in their graduation-project, students who attended the "enriched" introductory course with Scratch received higher grades. However, a difference in GPA at graduation could not be found.

This suggests that graphical programming languages like Scratch are valuable tools for learning programming. Especially beginners tend to be intimidated by traditional coding syntax. While Scratch should not be seen as an alternative to traditional scripting languages like Python or C, it is an example of how graphical programming languages are well suited for beginners' first projects. With Scratch, beginners can gain a broad understanding of algorithmic thinking, problem solving, and software design without having to focus on coding syntax.

### Procedure

>[!info] Comparing Students' Performance at Different Time Points
>![[Comparison_control_experimental.png]]
**Figure:** Students from the classical 'Introduction to Programming' course (Control group) are compared to students from the enriched 'Introduction to Programming' course (Experimental group). Figures for comparison are the grades in the 'Introduction to Programming' course, grades in the senior project (graduation project) and the cumulative GPA.

#### Conclusion

The study by Topalli and Cagiltay shows how implementing Scratch into introductory programming courses can look like. Improvements in students' graduation projects even years after the intervention took place, show how digital games like Scratch can assist students in learning programming. Scratch can assist individuals in being creative while gaining a broad understanding of algorithmic thinking, problem solving, and software design without having to focus on coding syntax.
