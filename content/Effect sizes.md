#### Moderate effect size for Digital Games vs. other Instructional Methods 
$ES = 0.667, 95$%$-CI [0.520–0.814], p < 0.001)$ 


| $ES$ / $d$ - Effect size | Interpretation |
| ------------------------ | -------------- |
| $< 0.2$                  | Low            |
| ~ $0.5$                  | Moderate       |
| $> 0.8$                  | Large          |

**Table**: Interpretation of effect sizes according to Cohen (1988)

#### Large effect size for Digital Games in Primary education
$ES = 0.835, p < 0.001$ 


| $ES$ / $d$ - Effect size | Interpretation |
| ------------------------ | -------------- |
| $< 0.2$                  | Low            |
| ~ $0.5$                  | Moderate       |
| $> 0.8$                  | Large          |

**Table**: Interpretation of effect sizes according to the convention (see Cohen, 1988).

#### Improvement in Dot-Subtraction Efficiency through Digital Games
$\eta^2_p = .08, F(2,182) = 8.08, p < .001$ 


| $\eta^2$ - Effect Size | Interpretation |
| ---------------------- | -------------- |
| ~ $0.01$               | Small effect   |
| ~ $0.06$               | Medium effect  |
| ~ $0.14$               | Large effect   |

**Table**: Interpretation of eta squared ($\eta^2$) effect sizes according to convention (Cohen, 1988; Miles & Shevlin, 2001).
