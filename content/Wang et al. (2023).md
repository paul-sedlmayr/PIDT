>Many researchers have explored the impact of digital games on learning effects in different [[Glossar#STEM|STEM]] subjects. The purpose of this meta‑analysis is to examine the effect of digital game‑based STEM education on the learning achieve‑ment of [[Glossar#K12|K12]]  or higher students. The analysis results of effect sizes from 33 studies (N = 3894) published from 2010 to 2020 showed that digital games contributed to a [[Effect sizes#`(ES = 0.667, 95% CI [0.520–0.814], p < 0.001)` for Digital Games vs. other Instructional Methods|moderate overall effect size]] when compared with other instructional methods. Furthermore, the study explored multiple moderator variables and their potential impacts on learning outcomes such as control treatment, subject discipline, educational level, game type, gaming platform, and intervention duration. The findings suggest that digital games are a promising pedagogical method in STEM education that effectively improves learning gains. Additionally, the study concludes with three recommendations for future research and practices on digital games in STEM education.



>[!Question]- Research Questions
>The key research questions that should be answered by the meta-analysis by [[Wang et al. (2023)|Wang and colleagues]] are as follows:
>- What is the overall effect of digital game-based STEM education on students’ learning achievement?
>- Are the learning gains higher when using digital games to support STEM education as compared to non-digital game-based methods?
>- Does the subject discipline impact students’ learning achievement in digital game-based learning settings?
>- Does the educational level infuence students’ learning achievement in digital game-based learning settings?
>- Do the gameplay designs (game types or gaming platforms) afect student achievement in digital game based learning settings?
>- Does the intervention duration impact students’ learning achievement in digital game-based learning settings?
