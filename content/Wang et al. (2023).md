>Many researchers have explored the impact of digital games on learning effects in different [[Glossar#STEM|STEM]] subjects. The purpose of this meta‑analysis is to examine the effect of digital game‑based STEM education on the learning achieve‑ment of [[Glossar#K12 or higher|K12 or higher]] students. The analysis results of effect sizes from 33 studies (N = 3894) published from 2010 to 2020 showed that digital games contributed to a [[Effect sizes#`(ES = 0.667, 95% CI [0.520–0.814], p < 0.001)`|moderate overall effect size]] when compared with other instructional methods. Furthermore, the study explored multiple moderator variables and their potential impacts on learning outcomes such as control treatment, subject discipline, educational level, [[Glossar#Non-digital games|game type]], gaming platform, and intervention duration. The findings suggest that digital games are a promising pedagogical method in STEM education that effectively improves learning gains. Additionally, the study concludes with three recommendations for future research and practices on digital games in STEM education.
