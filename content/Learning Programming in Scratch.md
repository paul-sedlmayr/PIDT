In their study, Topalli and Cagiltay examined the question how implementing Scratch, a graphical programming language, can improve the process of learning programming in higher education (2018). 

For one semester, an "Introduction to Programming"-course was supplemented with Scratch. As in previous semesters, students learned theoretical programming concepts and the programming language C. In this semester, students additional received an introduction to Scratch and created their own projects in Scratch. These students performed better in the course in comparison to other years. Even years later in their senior-project, students who attended the "enriched" introductory course with Scratch received higher grades. However, a difference in GPA at graduation could not be found.

This suggests that graphical programming languages like Scratch are valuable tools for learning programming. Especially beginners tend to be intimidated by traditional coding syntax. With Scratch, beginners can gain a broad understanding of algorithmic thinking, problem solving, and software design without having to focus on coding syntax.

### Overview

>[!Example] Topalli & Cagiltay (2018)
> ##### Goal of the Study
> Examine, how implementing Scratch in programming education can impact students' programming abilities.
> ##### Main Finding
> Enriching an introductory programming course with Scratch improves students' programming. This improvement showed in the students' senior project years later.
