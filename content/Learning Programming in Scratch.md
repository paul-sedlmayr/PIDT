In their study, Topalli and Cagiltay examined the question how implementing Scratch, a graphical programming language, can improve the process of learning programming in higher education (2018). 

For one semester, an "Introduction to Programming"-course was supplemented with Scratch. As in previous semesters, students learned theoretical programming concepts and the programming language C. In this semester, students additionaly received an introduction to Scratch and created their own projects in Scratch. These students performed better in the course in comparison to other years. Even years later in their graduation-project, students who attended the "enriched" introductory course with Scratch received higher grades. However, a difference in GPA at graduation could not be found.

This suggests that graphical programming languages like Scratch are valuable tools for learning programming. Especially beginners tend to be intimidated by traditional coding syntax. With Scratch, beginners can gain a broad understanding of algorithmic thinking, problem solving, and software design without having to focus on coding syntax.

### Overview

>[!Example] Topalli & Cagiltay (2018)
> ##### Goal of the Study
> Examine, how implementing Scratch in programming education can impact students' programming abilities.
> ##### Main Findings
> Enriching an introductory programming course with Scratch improves students' programming abilities. This improvement showed in the students' senior project years later.
> - [[Effect sizes#Higher Academic Achievement in Introduction to Programming Course for Students with Scratch|Higher course grades]] of students in  Scratch-enriched course in comparison to students in regular course
> - [[Effect sizes#Higher Performance in Graduation Projects for Students with Scratch|Higher grades]] in graduation project by students in Scratch-enriched course
> - [[Effect sizes#No Difference in Overall Grades for Students with Scratch and Students with Traditional Course|No difference]] in overall grades between students in Scratch-enriched course and students in traditional course


### Procedure

**Figure:** Students from the classical 'Introduction to Programming' course (Control group) are compared to students from the enriched 'Introduction to Programming' course (Experimental group). Figures for comparison are the grades in the 'Introduction to Programming' course, grades in the senior project (graduation project) and the cumulative GPA.
