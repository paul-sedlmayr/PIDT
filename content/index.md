 Digital Games are making their way in to classrooms. Especially in the field of [[STEM#"Science Technology Engineering Mathematics"|STEM]]
, there is a high potential of making complex topics more tangible through Digital Games. However, it we need to examined, whether Digital Games are even more effective than traditional methods. In their meta-analysis, [[Wang et al. (2023)|Wang and colleagues]] summarized the scientific findings regarding Digital Games in STEM education.

### Overview

### What is the Study about?

The meta-analysis by [[Wang et al. (2023)|Wang and colleagues]] included 33 studies with a total of 3894 subjects. The studies compare the use of  digital games in STEM education compared with other instructional methods to promote students learning achievements. The included studies focused on K-12 or higher education and were published between 2010 – 2020.

>[!info]- Additional information
>Furthermore the meta-analysis by [[Wang et al. (2023)|Wang and colleagues]] also takes into account the different variables of the studies that can impact the learning methods effectiveness on the learning achievement. The most common and therefore considered moderating variables were:
> - Control treatment: traditional and multimedia
> - Subject discipline: Science, Mathematics and Technology/Engineering
> - Educational Level: Primary, Secondary and Higher Education
> - Game Type: Immersive, Tutorial and Board Games
> - Gaming Platform: Computers and Mobile devices
> - Intervention duration: under 1 week, 1 week to 1 month, 1 month to 3 months and over 3 months

>[!Question]- Research Questions
>The key research questions that should be answered by the meta-analysis by [[Wang et al. (2023)|Wang and colleagues]] are as follows:
>- What is the overall effect of digital game-based STEM education on students’ learning achievement?
>- Are the learning gains higher when using digital games to support STEM education as compared to non-digital game-based methods?
>- Does the subject discipline impact students’ learning achievement in digital game-based learning settings?
>- Does the educational level infuence students’ learning achievement in digital game-based learning settings?
>- Do the gameplay designs (game types or gaming platforms) afect student achievement in digital game based learning settings?
>- Does the intervention duration impact students’ learning achievement in digital game-based learning settings?


### Results

**Overall: Digital Games are an Effective Method in Education:**
Digital Games lead to a higher Learning Achievement than traditional approaches and other multimedia approaches.
- Large effect in comparison to other “multimedia approaches” (ES=0.85, p< .001)
- Moderate effect in comparison to traditional approaches (ES=0.56, p< .001)

**Education Level:** Especially young students in primary education benefit from Digital Games. This is likely due to their high motivation to use digital games. Yet, digital games are also an effective method in older age groups.

**Subject Discipline:** Among the STEM disciplines, Science, Engineering / Technology and Mathematics, some of the disciplines were more represented than others. Therefore, a concluding statement can not be made.

### Conclusion

> [!Note]- For students
> Concepts in STEM are often complex and difficult to grasp. Digital games can assist learning new STEM concepts. Integrating these games into lessons or study sessions can make learning more enjoyable and lead to improvements in understanding difficult concepts. 
>
>There are many digital games for STEM education. Click [[content/index#Examples of STEM-Games|here]] to see examples.

> [!success]- For Teachers
> Digital games offer a great potential in STEM education. The meta-analysis by Wang and colleagues supports benefits in students' learning achievement. Concepts in STEM are often complex and difficult to grasp. Digital games are associated with high motivation which leads to an enjoyable learning experience. Implementing them into education can assist students in better understanding complex concepts and applying them in a digital environment. 
>
>Using Digital Games for short time periods (< 1 week) is linked to the highest improvements. However, this does not mean that digital games should only be used for short time periods. While the excitement around the novelty of a digital game usually decreases over time, digital games still improve learning achievements over longer time periods (weeks to months). 
>    
> In general, computers as well as mobile devices can be suitable platforms for educational games. The appropriate platform can be chosen depending on availability, students' learning goals and students' characteristics

> [!question]- For Parents
>Understanding how learning occurs in schools is crucial for parents. New progressive approaches can initially meet with misunderstanding or provoke anxiety, particularly concerning increased screen time. This article highlights the benefits of digital-based games, illustrating how they can be effectively implemented and enhance engagement with certain school tasks. 
>
>Especially students in primary education benefit a lot from learning with digital games. While learning with the assistance of digital games is beneficial across all age groups, there is a particularly [[Effect sizes#Large effect size for Digital Games in Primary education|large effect]] for students' in primary education. This is likely due to their high interest in using digital games to discover.

>[!Danger]- For Game Designers
> - Gameplay design: STEM concepts are often complex and multi-dimensional. Improvements in gameplay design and game mechanisms improve student's motivation and thus, the construction of knowledge. Integrating various information resources and emerging technologies should help to improve the sense of immersion. 
> - Plattform: In general, computers as well as mobile devices are effective platforms for educational games. Yet, extending from computers to mobile devices is suggested to increase availability. 
> - Players' characteristics like educational level or personality should be considered in game design to meet individual preferences.

>[!abstract]- For Reseachers
>- Gameplay desgin: [[Wang et al. (2023)]] call for improved gameplay design and game mechanisms to improve usability and thus, learning motivation.   
>- Effects of different game types should be further examined. Especially for (digital) board games, there is little research, yet promising results.
>- Learners' characteristics (educational level, inter-individual differences) should be further considered. 
>- Future research should examine the interplay of digital games with other technologies to increase immersion. This should increase learning motivation and learning experiences.
