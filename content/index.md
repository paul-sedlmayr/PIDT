 Digital Games are making their way in to classrooms. Especially in the field of [[Glossar#STEM|STEM]], there is a high potential of making complex topics more tangible through Digital Games. However, it we need to examined, whether Digital Games are even more effective than traditional methods. In their meta-analysis, [[Wang et al. (2023)]] summarized the scientific findings regarding Digital Games in STEM education.


### Overview 

>[!Example] Wang et al. (2023)
> ##### Goal of the Study
> Examine the effectiveness of Digital Games in [[Glossar#STEM|STEM]] education for [[Glossar#K12|K12]] students and higher education students 
> ##### Main Finding
> **Digital Games have a [[Effect sizes#Moderate effect size for Digital Games vs. other Instructional Methods|moderate overall effect size]] in promoting learning achievement**, compared to other instructional methods. This suggests that Digital Games are a suitable educational method.
> ##### Other Findings
> - Finding 1
