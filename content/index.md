 Digital Games are making their way in to classrooms. Especially in the field of [[STEM#"Science Technology Engineering Mathematics"|STEM]]
, there is a high potential of making complex topics more tangible through Digital Games. However, it we need to examined, whether Digital Games are even more effective than traditional methods. In their meta-analysis, [[Wang et al. (2023)|Wang and colleagues]] summarized the scientific findings regarding Digital Games in STEM education.


### Overview 

>[!Example] Wang et al. (2023)
> ##### Goal of the Study
> Examine the effectiveness of Digital Games in [[STEM#"Science Technology Engineering Mathematics"|STEM]] education for [[K12#"Kindergraden to 12th grade"|K12]] students and higher education students. 
> ##### Main Finding
> **[[Game types#Digital Games|Digital Games]] have a [[Effect sizes#Moderate effect size for Digital Games vs. other Instructional Methods|moderate overall effect size]] in promoting learning achievement**, compared to other instructional methods. This suggests that Digital Games are a suitable educational method.
> ##### Other Findings
> - Digital games are suitable for STEM education in different age groups. However, it shows the highest efficacy among younger students.

### Introduction


### What is the Study about?

The meta-analysis by [[Wang et al. (2023)|Wang and colleagues]] included 33 studies with a total of 3894 subjects. The studies compare the use of  digital games in STEM education compared with other instructional methods to promote students learning achievements. The included studies focused on K-12 or higher education and were published between 2010 – 2020.

>[!info]- Additional information
>Furthermore the meta-analysis by [[Wang et al. (2023)|Wang and colleagues]] also takes into account the different variables of the studies that can impact the learning methods effectiveness on the learning achievement. The most common and therefore considered moderating variables were:
> - Control treatment: traditional and multimedia
> - Subject discipline: Science, Mathematics and Technology/Engineering
> - Educational Level: Primary, Secondary and Higher Education
> - Game Type: Immersive, Tutorial and Board Games
> - Gaming Platform: Computers and Mobile devices
> - Intervention duration: under 1 week, 1 week to 1 month, 1 month to 3 months and over 3 months

>[!Question]- Research Questions
>The key research questions that should be answered by the meta-analysis by [[Wang et al. (2023)|Wang and colleagues]] are as follows:
>- What is the overall effect of digital game-based STEM education on students’ learning achievement?
>- Are the learning gains higher when using digital games to support STEM education as compared to non-digital game-based methods?
>- Does the subject discipline impact students’ learning achievement in digital game-based learning settings?
>- Does the educational level infuence students’ learning achievement in digital game-based learning settings?
>- Do the gameplay designs (game types or gaming platforms) afect student achievement in digital game based learning settings?
>- Does the intervention duration impact students’ learning achievement in digital game-based learning settings?

### Conclusion

> [!Note]- For students
> zx

> [!success]- For Teachers
> xyz
> - Intervention duration: Using Digital Games for short time periods (< 1 week) is linked to the highest effects. However, this does not mean that digital games should only be used for short time periods. The excitement around the novelty of a digital game might fade over time. Yet, digital games still improve learning achievements over longer time periods (weeks to months).      
> - Platform: In general, computers as well as mobile devices can be suitable platforms for educational games. The appropriate platform can be chosen depending on availability, students' learning goals and students' characteristics

> [!question]- For Parents
>- Especially students in primary education benefit a lot from learning with digital games. While learning with the assistance of digital games is beneficial across all age groups, there is a particularly [[Effect sizes#Large effect size for Digital Games in Primary education|large effect]] for students' in primary education. This is likely due to their high interest in using digital games to discover.


>[!Danger]- For Game Designers
> - Gameplay design: STEM concepts are often complex and multi-dimensional. Improvements in gameplay design and game mechanisms improve student's motivation and thus, the construction of knowledge. Integrating various information resources and emerging technologies should help to improve the sense of immersion. 
> - Plattform: In general, computers as well as mobile devices are effective platforms for educational games. Yet, extending from computers to mobile devices is suggested to increase availability. 
> - Players' characteristics like educational level or personality should be considered in game design to meet individual preferences.


>[!abstract]- For Reseachers
>- Gameplay desgin: [[Wang et al. (2023)]] call for improved gameplay design and game mechanisms to improve usability and thus, learning motivation.   
>- Effects of different game types should be further examined. Especially for (digital) board games, there is little research, yet promising results.
>- Learners' characteristics (educational level, inter-individual differences) should be further considered. 
>- Future research should examine the interplay of digital games with other technologies to increase immersion. This should increase learning motivation and learning experiences.
