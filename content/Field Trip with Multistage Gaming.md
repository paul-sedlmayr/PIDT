> ##### Goal of the Study
> Examine, how a implementing a mobile game and multistage guiding can impact students learning performance and motivation on a natural-science field-trip.
> ##### Main Findings
>- Integrating a mobile game in the field-trip [[Effect sizes#Increased Learning Achievement through Mobile Game|significantly increases]] the learning achievement compared to a non-game approach
>- Multistage guiding mechanism [[Effect sizes#Increased Learning Achievement through Multistage Guiding Mechanism|significantly enhanced]]  the students learning achievements.
>- Using the gaming approach can promote the motivation of the students who participated in the mobile learning activity with the multistage guiding mechanism.
