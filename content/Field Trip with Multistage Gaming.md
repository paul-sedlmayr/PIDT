### Abstract

>[!abstract]+
>In this study, an integrated gaming and multistage guiding approach was proposed for conducting in-ﬁeld mobile learning activities. A mobile learning system was developed based on the proposed approach. To investigate the interaction between the gaming and guiding strategies on students’ learning performance and motivation, a 2 × 2 experiment was conducted on an elementary school natural science course. Four groups of students were situated in a ﬁeld trip to learn with different mobile learning approaches (i.e., gaming or nongaming) and guiding mechanisms (i.e., multistage or single-stage). The experimental results showed that both the gaming and multistage guiding mechanisms proposed in this study signiﬁcantly enhanced the students’ learning achievements. Moreover, the interaction between the two showed that the lead-in of the gaming strategy could signiﬁcantly improve the learning motivation of the students who learned with the multistage guiding mechanism; on the contrary, their learning motivation could be signiﬁcantly decreased without the gaming approach, although the multistage guiding mechanism was effective. The ﬁndings imply that “gamiﬁcation” could be a good approach for helping students accept learning support or tools provided in mobile learning scenarios.
