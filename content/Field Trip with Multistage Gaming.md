Science field trips can be fun, but they can also quickly become annoying as soon as you must complete tasks. This study investigated how to promote motivation for the tasks and achieve greater learning success on elementary school field trips. It also aimed to help children in their learning, in this case through multistage guiding.

> ##### Goal of the Study 
>This study conducted an experiment with 97 pupils aged 10-11 years. They were provided with a mobile game that was structured like a board game. With its help, they were supposed to use it to discover more about plants on a natural science field trip and learn to recognize them.

> ##### Main Findings
>- Integrating a mobile game in the field-trip [[Effect sizes#Increased Learning Achievement through Mobile Game|significantly increases]] the learning achievement compared to a non-game approach
>- Multistage guiding mechanism [[Effect sizes#Increased Learning Achievement through Multistage Guiding Mechanism|significantly enhanced]]  the students learning achievements.
>- Using the gaming approach can promote the motivation of the students who participated in the mobile learning activity with the multistage guiding mechanism.

>[!bug]+ Game Structure
>
>Students used tablet computers to interact through the game with their environment, identifying plants on their school campus. The game involved a map with tagged locations representing real-world learning targets. Students started with an initial score and threw dice to move on the map. At each location, they scanned a QR Code and answered multiple-choice questions or completed matching games about the plant's features. Correct answers increased their scores, and the top five scores were displayed.
>
>If a student answered incorrectly, the system provided hints in a multistage guiding form, starting with comparisons to other plants and progressing to sketches and videos if further mistakes were made. The game encouraged students to recognize plant features correctly to "purchase" and increase the value of the plant properties. Visiting plants owned by others transferred some points to the plant's owner, adding a competitive element.

### Conclusion

The game’s board game-like structure is underrepresented in digital educational games, even though offering a great way to guide and motivate students, boosting their learning achievement. It combines digital play with real-world interaction, letting children engage with learning materials both on-screen and physically.

Navigating support and guidance while encouraging children in learning activities is challenging, as repetitive questioning or simply providing the correct answer can be unmotivating and less beneficial. However, the multistage guiding approach effectively motivates children by providing structured hints and feedback, enhancing their learning experience. Additionally, this guiding method is better received in a mobile game setting.

In summary, it can be shown that a combination of a digital mobile game and multistage guiding system is a beneficial way of learning during science field trips.
