Van der Ven et al. (2017) investigated the impact of a tablet game intervention on the arithmetic fluency of 103 first graders, focusing on simple addition and subtraction. As children approach the end of grade 1, they are expected to become proficient in these operations. The goal is to enhance arithmetic fluency by promoting faster and more efficient calculation and retrieval of memorized answers. The children were divided into two groups: one group practiced arithmetic using a specially designed tablet game for five weeks, while the control group continued with regular education. The tablet game sessions were held for 15 minutes, four times a week. Pre-intervention and post-intervention assessments measured the children's proficiency in both symbolic and non-symbolic arithmetic.

The intervention improved dot-subtraction efficiency, suggesting benefits in calculation rather than retrieval speed or a shift from calculation to retrieval through memorization. The absence of improvement in Arabic-arithmetic fluency might be due to an already high level of memorized problem-answer pairs or the short duration of the intervention.

>Enhancing arithmetic fluency by promoting faster and more efficient calculation and retrieval of memorized answers.
>##### Main Findings
>- Children found the game highly enjoyable, with [[Effect sizes#High Enjoyment of Digital Game|ratings]] close to the maximum score.
>- The intervention [[Effect sizes#Improvement in Dot-Subtraction Efficiency through Digital Games|significantly improved]] dot-subtraction efficiency, suggesting benefits in calculation rather than retrieval speed or a shift from calculation to retrieval through memorization.




### Procedure

>![[procedure_arithmetic.png]]
>
>**Figure:** 103 first graders were divided in either the experimental group or in the control group. Arithmetic skills and attitude towards mathematics were measured before, directly after, and 13 weeks after the intervention. Tablet game motivation was assessed in the pre- and posttest. In the pretest, additional measurements such as mathematic skills (CITO), non-verbal reasoning skills, working attitude, visual working memory, general motor speed, word voicing efficiency, and digit naming efficiency.


### Conclusion

The study by Van der Ven and colleagues highlights the advantages of digital games in providing direct feedback and enhancing engagement, though it notes limitations such as the lack of a non-digital game comparison group and uncertainties about the control group's additional activities.
